        <ul>
            <li>12 c water or part beef or vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2-3 lb of soup meat  (beef shank or short ribs) traditionally made with deckel or flanken</li>
            <li>1 large onion, peeled and coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>4 - 5 large carrots, peeled and chopped into 1/2 in chunks</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1.5 cups of green split peas, sorted</li>
            <li>1 cup dried lima beans, sorted</li>
            <li>1/2 cup hulled barley</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly cracked, black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place your beef shank or other meat, meat side up on a foil covered pan. Sprinkle with fresh-cracked black pepper. There is no need to add salt if you salted your meat overnight or if you are using kosher meat. Roast for 15 minutes. Then turn the meat over and roast for 12 more minutes. Turn them on their side and roast for about 8 to 10 more minutes or until well-browned. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Place the lovely, roasted meat into the bottom of a large, heavy-bottomed pot (6 or 7 quart enameled cast iron is best.) Rinse very well the split peas, beans and barley. Then add them and all of the remaining ingredients into the pot with the meat. </li>
            <li>Cover everything in the pot with your liquid of choice. You want the liquid to be about 2-inches above the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bring the liquid to a boil, then cover the pot and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 3 hours, checking occasionally to make sure that your liquid hasn’t all evaporated. You can add additional liquid to keep things from drying out. By this time, the split peas have become mush and the beans, barley and meat are tender. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The soup should be thick and will continue to thicken as it sits. The barley will add a creamy thickness to the soup. Exactly how thick you like your soup is between you and you.</p>

        <p>If you made the soup ahead and are reheating it, you will likely need to add some additional liquid. This soup does freeze well so don’t be afraid to make a big batch. Winter has only just begun!</p>
